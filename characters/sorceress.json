  "Class": "sorceress",
  "Script": "The Sorceress is one of the original five classes from Diablo II. She specializes exclusively in elemental magic, and all of her spells fall into one of three domains: cold, lightning and fire. She is the glass cannon of the classes, focusing in spells that deal heavy elemental damage and starting with the biggest mana pool. In melee battle she is very weak, but can still function in hand-to-hand combat with the right gear and skills (see the Enchantress). The Sorceress appears as a very curious character in the game, often remarking at magical phenomenon and constantly expressing a wish to study the various places and items she comes across."
