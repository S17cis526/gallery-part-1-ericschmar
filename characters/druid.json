  "Script": "The Druid is one of the two expansion characters introduced in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Masters of nature, the druids were originally the same people as the barbarians until they left their tribesmen during the time of Bul-Kathos. Since then the druids have been living in the northern woods of Scosglen, secluding themselves more against from the world around them than even the barbarians did prior to the events of Diablo II. The druid combines various features from previous classes in the game: elemental magic like the Sorceress, summoning skills like the Necromancer, aura-bestowing spirits like the Paladin along with the new shape shifting skills which allow the druid to engage in close quarters combat. The elemental and shapeshifting skills can be quite potent if utilized correctly by the player. Unfortunately, the summoning skills act more as a support tree, as a summoning druid can never achieve the same potency as a Summonancer. It is quite capable of finishing normal, but will run into massive trouble in hell difficulty."
