  "Class" : "assassin",
  "Script" : "The Assassins weapon of choice is the claw weapon, which she dual wields with high efficiency. Utilizing charge up-techniques and finishing moves, the assassin builds up charges in a skill in order to unleash it with a finisher. More charges equals a more powerful effect. This makes the Martial Arts Assassin very different from any other class, as she actively requires the player to switch back and forth between two types of skills. Interesting as the Martial Arts may be, it is the Trap Assassin, or Trapsin, which is the most powerful build type. Similar to the Hydra spell, traps become stationary objects that discharge their spells upon enemies. There are fire and lightning traps, the latter of which are the most potent."
