  "Script" : "The Barbarian, a member of any of several tribes on the fringes of civilization, rebuffs the influence of those he sees as soft and weak. Ceaseless clan warfare and the constant struggle to survive in the hostile wilderness are evident in the Barbarian's sturdy and powerful frame. Though perhaps lacking the sophistication of his civilized contemporaries, the Barbarian has an acute awareness of his surroundings. Because of his shamanistic belief in the animal powers with whom he identifies, the Barbarian is sometimes associated with stories of lycanthropy. In fact, he believes that he can improve his superb battle tactics by calling upon the totemic animal spirits to infuse him with supernormal strengths and abilities. The Barbarian is a playable character class in Diablo II who specializes in melee combat skills and perfecting his use of melee weapons. He also has the ability to strengthen his allies with a Warcry before battle, create barbaric totems from slain demons and leap great distances. The barbarian is able to dual wield any weapon. Unlike other classes."
