  "Class": "paladin",
  "Script" : "The Paladin is one of the five original classes in Diablo II, along with the Amazon, Barbarian, Necromancer and Sorceress. He is a melee-oriented character, with any auras and abilites to augment his own abilities and stats or crippling his enemies. The Paladin is however not limited to close-range combat, as one of the most successful builds in the game, the Hammerdin, utilizes the skill Blessed Hammer for damage. The Paladin is originally a warrior of the Zakarum faith, protecting the believers in a dangerous world and working to convert unbelievers. As of the events in Diablo II however, there has been a split in the Church, with the Paladins rejecting the now corrupted leadership in Kurast. The player belongs to a Paladin of this faction."
